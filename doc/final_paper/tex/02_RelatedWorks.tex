\section{Related Works}
Balle et. al's work in modifying neural networks (NNs) (variational autoencoders) for data compression provided the inspiration for modifications to the RL agent for data compression ~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/BalleLS16a}.\\
Furthermore, a variety of work explores using RL agents in data compression, including pruning for image compression~\cite{pruning2}~\cite{pruning3}~\cite{pruning1}, optimal codebook mapping~\cite{8954232}, NN architecture compression~\cite{nn_arch_comp}, sentence compression~\cite{inbook}, and state compression for RL agents~\cite{9387144}. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous research exists in the task-dependent image compression domain.
