\section{Discussion}
As can be seen in Figure 1, our baseline with the image MSE produced encouraging results: the location of the paddle was consistently preserved. However, areas of improvement include the artifacts that exist in this paddle along with the loss of the ball. As seen in Figure 2, use of the latent loss scheme resulted in extreme artifacts, as well as the loss of the paddle and did not result in ball recovery. A new scheme or use of this scheme would be needed.
